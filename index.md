My name is **Robert Maier** and I am a Computer Vision Engineer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/){:target="_blank"} in Munich, focused on 3D reconstruction.

# Research Interests
My research interests include *(real-time) RGB-D based 3D Reconstruction, Visual SLAM, Visual Odometry, Shape-from-Shading and Bundle Adjustment techniques*. Please visit my [publication page](http://www.rmaier.net/publications/) to find out more about my research.

# Brief Bio
I have joined [Apple Munich](https://www.apple.com/){:target="_blank"} in October 2019 as a Computer Vision Engineer, where I am working on cutting edge 3D reconstruction techniques. Before that, I was a Research Assistant and Doctorate Candidate at the [Chair for Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence](http://vision.in.tum.de/){:target="_blank"} at the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de/){:target="_blank"}, headed by [Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers){:target="_blank"}, from May 2014 until October 2019. Within the scope of my PhD activities, I spent several months as a Computer Vision Research Intern at [Oculus Research](https://www.oculus.com/research/){:target="_blank"} (Redmond, WA, USA) and [NVIDIA Research](https://research.nvidia.com/){:target="_blank"} (Santa Clara, CA, USA). From 2013 to 2014 I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer for medical imaging and RGB-D based 3D reconstruction at [ImFusion](http://www.imfusion.de/){:target="_blank"} (Munich).
I have received my Bachelor’s degree (2010) and my Master’s degree (2013, with distinction) in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich (Germany). During my Master’s studies, I spent an exchange semester at [UPC Barcelona](http://www.upc.edu/){:target="_blank"} (Spain) in 2011/2012, before I worked as a Computer Vision Research Intern at [Siemens Corporate Research](http://www.usa.siemens.com/en/about_us/research/home.htm){:target="_blank"} in Princeton, NJ (USA) in 2012/2013. Moreover, I have a Computer Science Expert degree and many years experience of working as a Software Engineer. Please have a look at my [CV](http://www.rmaier.net/cv/) for more information.
